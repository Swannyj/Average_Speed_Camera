# Average_Speed_Camera
A simple application used to demonstrate how average speed cameras work as well as improving them


Question: Do average speed cameras make allowance for stopping at traffic lights in between cameras? If not, this is obviously going to bring down your average speed?

Answer: Average speed cameras cannot take into account traffic lights and the stopping time at them between camera locations.

This application will try and demonstrate how the UK government can take into account traffic lights with average speed cameras.
